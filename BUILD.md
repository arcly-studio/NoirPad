# Building NoirPad

Releases are built by `build.ps1`, locally or in GitHub Actions — the same steps either way.

## Requirements (Windows 10/11, x64)

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.14 (`.python-version`) | from python.org or the `py` launcher; other versions are untested |
| Node.js | 22+ | only for the JS tests (vitest); the app has no JS build step |
| Inno Setup | 6 | `ISCC.exe` on PATH or in the default install folder (`choco install innosetup`) |
| Git | any | the build refuses to run on a dirty tree |

All Python packages are pinned: `requirements.txt` (runtime) and `requirements-dev.txt`
(tests + PyInstaller). JS dev packages are pinned in `package-lock.json`.

## One command

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/arcly-studio/NoirPad.git
cd NoirPad
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1
```

`build.ps1`:

1. stops if `git status` is not clean — what ships is exactly a commit;
2. creates `.venv` (Python 3.14) if missing and installs `requirements-dev.txt`;
3. `npm ci`, then `pytest` and `vitest` — any failure stops the build;
4. PyInstaller with `noirpad.spec` → `dist\NoirPad\NoirPad.exe` (onedir; ~45 MB);
5. smoke test (`tools/smoke_test.ps1`) of that very `dist\NoirPad`: `NoirPad.exe --smoke-test`
   with a throwaway `NOIRPAD_DATA_DIR` must import every module it loads by name at run time
   (`noirpad/runtime_imports.py`), answer `GET /api/version` with 200 within 15 s and exit
   cleanly — otherwise no installer is built;
6. Inno Setup with `installer.iss` → `dist\installer\NoirPad-Setup-<version>.exe` (~19 MB)
   and `NoirPad-Setup-<version>.exe.sha256`.

Options: `-Python C:\path\to\python.exe` (interpreter for the venv), `-Iscc C:\path\to\ISCC.exe`.

## Version

The version lives **only** in `noirpad/__version__.py` (`__version__`, plus `PROJECT_URL`). The API
(`/api/version`), the About box, the exe's version resource (spec) and the installer
(`/DAppVersion`, passed by `build.ps1`) all read it from there. A test fails if the version string
appears anywhere else.

## Releasing

1. Update `__version__` and add a section to `CHANGELOG.md` (`## [x.y.z] – date`).
2. Commit, then tag and push: `git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3`.
3. `.github/workflows/release.yml` checks that the tag matches `__version__`, runs `build.ps1` on
   `windows-latest` and creates a **draft** release with the installer, its `.sha256` and the
   changelog section. Review it and publish.

`.github/workflows/test.yml` runs pytest + vitest and the whole `build.ps1` (incl. the smoke
test) on every push and pull request.

## Notes

- **Data directory:** both the exe and `python desktop.py` / `python NoirPad-web.py` use
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NoirPad`. For testing, set `NOIRPAD_DATA_DIR` to a scratch folder so real notes
  are never touched. `tools/demo_data.py <dir> [--lang cs]` fills a folder with demo notes;
  `tools/take_screenshots.py [--gif]` starts `desktop.py` on them and regenerates the README's
  `docs/screenshots/` (and `docs/demo.gif`) over the WebView2 DevTools protocol (needs
  `pip install playwright`, plus `ffmpeg` and `oxipng` on PATH).
- **Logo (M1 "glass sheets", 1.0.1):** the sources are `docs/brand/noirpad-icon.svg` (40 px and
  up) and `noirpad-icon-small.svg` (32 px and less) with the raster export
  `docs/brand/noirpad-1024.png`. `noirpad.ico` (exe, window, installer), `static/favicon.ico`,
  `static/img/` (copies of both SVGs, `tests/test_brand.py` keeps them equal) and `docs/logo.png`
  are exported from them; `tools/make_wizard_images.ps1` regenerates the installer's
  `installer/wizard-small-*.bmp` (32-bit with alpha). The UI shows the SVG through `<img>` only
  (never inline: the file has `id`s). Icon URLs in `static/index.html` and `static/manifest.json`
  end in `?v=__NP_VERSION__`; the server fills in the version, so browsers drop a cached old icon.
  `docs/brand/social-preview.png` (1280×640) is a headless-Chrome screenshot of
  `docs/brand/social-preview.html`.
- **Console:** the exe is windowed (no console). Diagnostics go to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NoirPad\logs\noirpad.log`; start-up failures also show a message box.
- **Code signing:** builds are not signed, so SmartScreen warns on first run (see README).
- **Installer:** per-user (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\NoirPad`), no admin rights. The `AppId` GUID in
  `installer.iss` must never change, or upgrades and uninstall break. `AppMutex` must stay equal to
  `APP_MUTEX` in `desktop.py`.
- **Single instance:** a lock file in the data directory allows one NoirPad (desktop or web) per
  data folder; a second desktop launch brings the running window to the front.
